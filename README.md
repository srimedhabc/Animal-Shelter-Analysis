# Animal-Shelter-Analysis
Prediction and Analysis of Animal Shelter Intakes and Outcomes

This project delves into the analysis and prediction of animal shelter intakes and outcomes using data 
from the Austin Animal Center. The dataset provides valuable insights into the shelter's operations, 
including the demographics of animals, the reasons for their intake, and the final outcomes such as 
adoption, transfer, or euthanasia. By employing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical 
modeling, the report aims to identify patterns, optimize shelter operations, and enhance animal 
welfare. 
Various models and statistical methods are utilized, including Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), 
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, Gradient 
Boosting, and XGBoost. Based on accuracy scores, XGBoost delivers the best performance, followed 
closely by Gradient Boosting. These models provide a robust foundation for understanding outcome 
predictors and improving decision-making processes at the shelter. Key findings highlight factors 
influencing adoption likelihood, time spent in the shelter, and the impact of specific programs like 
Shelter-Neuter-Release (SNR).

In this enitre analysis (**refer the ipynb file**), I evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict animal shelter outcomes. 
While XGBoost emerged as the top performer with the highest accuracy and the best ability to handle 
imbalanced classes, Gradient Boosting also showed reasonable performance. Despite some 
challenges with rare class prediction, these models offer useful insights into understanding animal 
shelter outcomes. Moving forward, improving model performance could involve fine-tuning 
hyperparameters, balancing the dataset, and exploring additional features or techniques for handling 
class imbalances.
